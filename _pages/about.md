Sichuan — California — Zurich

Hi, I am Junhao Zhang! I am a graduate student, an engineer, and a software developer for biomedical imaging and neuronavigation. I was born and brought up in Sichuan, China. I graduated from University of California, Santa Barbara with degrees in physics and mechanical engineering. I am currently a master student at ETH Zurich, Switzerland, and I will join Johns Hopkins University as a PhD student in the fall 2023.

I investigate noval medical imaging techniques and develop interactive visual representation of them for clinical analysis and medical intervention. With them, I present valuable information unattainable with existing state-of-the-art approaches for clinical practice. Ultimately, my goal is to deliver neuroradiology and neurosurgery solutions that are affordable, accurate, and convenient for every one.

Check out my [projects](https://Junha0Zhang.github.io/projects/) in the lab and University Hospital of Zurich!
