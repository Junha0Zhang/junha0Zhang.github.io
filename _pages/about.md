Hi, I am Junhao Zhang! I am a graduate student, an engineer, and a software developer for biomedical imaging and neuronavigation. I investigate noval medical imaging techniques and develop interactive visual representation of them for clinical analysis and medical intervention. My goal is to make neuroradiology and neurosurgery solutions affordable, accurate, and customizable for both doctors and patients using cutting-edge techniques.
