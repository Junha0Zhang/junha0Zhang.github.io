Sichuan — California — Zurich

Hi, I’m Junhao Zhang, a researcher specializing in biomedical imaging and image-guided surgery. I was born and raised in Sichuan, China. I earned dual bachelor's degrees in Physics and Mechanical Engineering from the University of California, Santa Barbara, and a master’s degree from ETH Zurich. Currently, I am a second-year PhD student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Johns Hopkins University.

My research focuses on developing novel medical imaging techniques and creating interactive visual representations for clinical analysis and surgical intervention. I am particularly interested in leveraging optimization, signal processing, machine learning, and probability theory to design algorithms that integrate the laws of physics to visualize and interpret the world. My ultimate goal is to advance radiology and surgical solutions that are accessible, accurate, and convenient for everyone.
