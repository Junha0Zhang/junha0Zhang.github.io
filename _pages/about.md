Sichuan — California — Zurich

Hi, I am Junhao Zhang! I am a graduate student, an engineer, and a software developer for biomedical imaging and neuronavigation. I was born and brought up in Sichuan, China. I graduated from University of California, Santa Barbara with degrees in physics and mechanical engineering. And I am currently a master student at ETH Zurich, Switzerland.

I investigate noval medical imaging techniques and develop interactive visual representation of them for clinical analysis and medical intervention. With them, I deliver valuable information unattainable with existing state-of-the-art approaches. Ultimately, my goal is to make neuroradiology and neurosurgery solutions affordable, accurate, and convenient for both doctors and patients using cutting-edge technologies.
