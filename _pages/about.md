Hi, I am Junhao Zhang! I am a graduate student, an engineer, and a software developer for biomedical imaging and neuronavigation. I investigate noval medical imaging techniques and develop interactive visual representation of them for clinical analysis and medical intervention. My goal is to make neuroradiology and neurosurgery solutions affordable, accurate, and customizable for both doctors and patients using cutting-edge techniques.

Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
